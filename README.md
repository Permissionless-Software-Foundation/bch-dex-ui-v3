# bch-dex-taker-v2

This is a web-based single page app (SPA) written in React. It is forked from [bch-wallet-web3-spa](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-web3-spa) and replaces [bch-dex-taker-ui](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-dex-taker-ui).

The purpose of this app is to provide a web-based interface for users to browse NFT and fungible tokens for sale on the SLP DEX protocol. This provides a simple 1-click purchase functionality. A different UI is used for selling tokens, as there are more requirements for sellers imposed by the SWaP protocol.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-dex-taker-v2
cd bch-dex-taker-v2
npm install
npm start
npm run build
```
